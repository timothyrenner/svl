# SVL: A ~Stupid~ Simple Grammar for Vega Lite

SVL is a text based language that compiles to [Vega Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) JSON.
It's designed for quick and dirty visualizations of datasets in a file.

*** This project is experimental. *** I made this project to learn and experiment with [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) context-free grammars.

More documentation around getting started, syntax, etc to come.
