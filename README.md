# SVL: A ~Stupid~ Simple Grammar for Data Visualizations

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timothyrenner/svl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/timothyrenner/svl)

SVL is a language for simple data visualizations.

*** This project is experimental. *** I made this project to learn and experiment with [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) context-free grammars.

More documentation around getting started, syntax, etc to come.
